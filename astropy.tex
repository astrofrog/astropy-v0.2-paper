\abstract{
We present the first public version of the open-source and community-developed
Python package, Astropy. This package aims to provide core astronomy-related
functionality to the community, including for example support for
domain-specific file formats such as Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)
files, Virtual Observatory (VO), and common ASCII table formats, unit and
physical quantity conversions, physical constants specific to astronomy,
celestial coordinate and time transformations, world coordinate system (WCS)
support, generalized containers for representing gridded as well as tabular
data, and a framework for cosmological transformations and conversions.
Significant functionality is under active development, such as a model fitting
framework, VO client and server tools, and aperture and point spread function
(PSF) photometry tools. Participation in development is open to anyone
interested in joining the project.

\section{Introduction}

% Authors: Tom R., Erik T., Perry G.

The Python programming language\footnote{\url{http://www.astropy.org}} has been
one of the fastest-growing programming languages in the astronomy community in
the last decade. While there have been a number of efforts to develop Python
packages for astronomy-specific functionality, these efforts have been
fragmented, and several dozens of packages have been developed across the
community with little or no coordination, leading to duplication and a lack of
homogeneity across packages. This in turn has made it difficult for users to
get set up with all the required packages needed in an Astronomer's toolkit.
Since a number of these packages depend on individual or small groups of
developers, packages are sometimes no longer maintained, or simply become
unavailable, which is detrimental to long-term research and research
reproducibility.

The Astropy project was started\footnote{Following discussions on
the \texttt{astropy} mailing list at
\url{http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy}} in 2011 out of a desire
to bring together developers across the field of astronomy in order to
coordinate efforts to develop a common Python library. The aim of this library
was to cover much of the astronomy-specific functionality needed by
researchers, complementing more general standard scientific packages such as
NumPy \citep{oliphant2006guide,van2011numpy} and SciPy \citep{jones2001scipy},
which are invaluable for numerical array-based calculations, and more general
scientific algorithms (e.g. interpolation, integration, clustering, etc.)
respectively. To date, over 130 people are signed up to the
\textit{development} mailing list for the Astropy project\footnote{
\url{https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups\#!forum/astropy-dev}}.

Most efforts in the Astropy project to date have gone towards developing the
core \astropy package. However, we note the scope of the Astropy project is
not simply to create a core package, but more generally to bring together
authors of existing packages to work together and agree on including a common
set of functionality in the core package (and in some cases deprecating their
packages if all functionality ends up in \astropy), since the aim is
ultimately to simplify the landscape of packages available to users. In
addition, the Astropy project includes more specialized Python packages (which
we call \textit{affiliated} packages) that are not included in the core
package for various reasons: for some the functionality is in early stages of
development and is not robust; or the license is not compatible with Astropy;
the package includes large files; or the functionality is mature, but too
specific to be included in a core package.

In this paper, we present the first public release (v0.2) of the \astropy
package. We provide an overview of the current capabilities
(\S\ref{sec:capabilities}), our development workflow (\S\ref{sec:workflow}),
and planned functionality (\S\ref{sec:future}).


\section{Capabilities}

\label{sec:capabilities}


\subsection{Units, Quantities, and Physical Constants}

% Authors: Perry, Mike, Adrian, Tom R.

The \texttt{astropy.units} package provides support for physical
units.  It is based on the code in the \texttt{pynbody} package
[reference?]  written by Andrew Pontzen, but has since been enhanced
in behavior and implementation.

Converting between units is simple:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> from astropy import units as u
>>> # Convert from parsec to meter
>>> u.pc.to(u.m)
3.0856776e+16
\end{verbatim}
The user can also define their own units, either as standalone base
units or by composing other units together.  This is done using simple
mathematical operators.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> # Define some custom units
>>> cms = u.cm / u.s
>>> mph = u.mile / u.hour
>>> cms.to(mph, 1)
0.02236936292054402
\end{verbatim}

Astropy knows about certain physical ``concepts'' and is able to
deduce the purpose of a unit, even if it is user-defined.  Using the
example of mile-per-hour (\texttt{mph}) from above:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> mph = u.mile / u.hour
>>> mph.physical_type
u'speed'
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{astropy.units} includes unit definitions in both the
International System of Units (SI) and the Centimeter-Gram-Second
(CGS) systems, as well as a number of astronomy- and
astrophysics-specific units.  Converting between systems is possible:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> u.Pa.to_system(u.cgs)
[Unit("1.000000e+01 Ba")]
\end{verbatim}

It's also possible to decompose units into their base units, and then
pattern match those parts against known units.
\begin{verbatim}
>>> u.Hz.decompose()
Unit("1 / (s)")
>>> (1.0 / u.s).compose()
>>> (u.s ** -1).compose()
[Unit("Hz"), ...]
\end{verbatim}

Included is the concept of ``equivalencies'' in units, where there
exists an equation that provides a relationship between two different
physical quantities such that providing either one uniquely defines
the other.  A standard astronomical example is the relationships
between the frequency, wavelength and energy of a photon.  Specify
one, and you specify all the others. It is common practice to treat
the units as equivalent even though they aren't strictly comparable.
This unit package supports defining such relationships, and it is one
of the areas that distinguish itself from most other units handling
software.  For example, wavelength and frequency are not normally
convertible:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> u.nm.to(u.Hz, [1000, 2000])
UnitsException: 'nm' (length) and 'Hz'
(frequency) are not convertible
\end{verbatim}
However, by passing an equivalency list (\texttt{u.spectral()}), it
does:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> u.nm.to(u.Hz, [1000, 2000],
            equivalencies=u.spectral())
array([  2.99792458e+14,   1.49896229e+14])
\end{verbatim}
Equivalencies are also included for flux densities, and end users can
easily implement their own equivalencies.

%TODO: add a description of the original motivation for equivalencies: 
%flux density conversions.  Also possibly a description of the on-list 
%discussion of the complexities in this topic 

It's well known that there are multiple string representations for
units used in the astronomy community.  The FITS Standard
\cite{fits2008} defines a unit standard, as well as both the Centre de
Donn\'ees astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) \citep{ochsenbein2000cds}
and NASA/Goddard's Office of Guest Investigator Programs (OGIP)
\citep{george1995ogip}.  In additional, the International Virtual
Observatory Alliance (IVOA) has a forthcoming VOUnit standard
\citep{derriere2012vounit} in an attempt to resolve some of these
differences.  Rather than choose one of these, \texttt{astropy.units}
supports all of these standards\footnote{OGIP support is forthcoming
  at the time of this writing.}, and allows the user to select the
appropriate one when reading and writing unit string definitions to
and from external file formats.

Also included in the \texttt{astropy.units} package is the
\texttt{Quantity} object, which represents a numerical value with an
associated unit.  This objects support arithmetic with other numbers
and \texttt{Quantity} objects and preserve their units:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> x = 15.1 * u.m / (32.0 * u.s)
>>> x
<Quantity 0.471875 m / (s)>
>>> x.unit
Unit("m / (s)")
>>> x.value
0.471875
\end{verbatim}

These \texttt{Quantity} objects are used to define a number of useful
astronomical constants included with \texttt{astropy}, each with an
associated unit (where applicable) and additional metadata describing
their provenance and uncertainties.
\begin{verbatim}
>>> from astropy.constants import si
>>> print si.c
  Name   = Speed of light in vacuum
  Value  = 299792458.0
  Error  = 0.0
  Units = m / (s)
  Reference = CODATA 2010
>>> print si.c.to('km/s')
299792.458 km / (s)
\end{verbatim}

The combination of all of the above ends up being rather powerful:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> from astropy.constants import G, M_sun
>>> F = G * (3. * M_sun) *
        (2. * u.kg) / (1.5 * u.au)**2
>>> F.to(u.N)
<Quantity 0.01581795428812989 N>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Time}

% Authors: Tom A.

The \texttt{astropy.time} package provides functionality for manipulating
times and dates.  Specific emphasis is placed on supporting time scales
(e.g. UTC, TAI, UT1) and time representations (e.g. JD, MJD, ISO 8601) that
are used in astronomy.

This package uses Cython\footnote{\url{http://www.cython.org/}} to wrap the C
language SOFA\citep{SOFA:2010-12-01} time and calendar
routines\footnote{\url{http://www.iausofa.org/2012_0301_C/sofa/sofa_ts_c.pdf}}.
Leveraging the robust and well-tested
SOFA\footnote{\url{http://www.iausofa.org}} routines ensures that the
fundamental time scale conversions are being computed correctly.  An important
feature of the SOFA time library is that each time is represented as a pair of
double-precision values.  This is supported in \texttt{astropy.time} and
provides the capability to do extremely high precision time computations.  All
time scale conversions are done by Cython vectorized versions of the SOFA
routines and are reasonable fast and memory efficient.

The basic way to use \texttt{astropy.time} is to create a \texttt{Time} object
by supplying one or more input time values as well as the time format and time
scale of those values.  The input time(s) can either be a single scalar like
\verb|"2010-01-01 00:00:00"| or \verb|2455348.5| or an array of such values.
The output value(s) will have the same shape (scalar or array) as the input.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from astropy.time import Time
>>> t = Time('2010-06-01 00:00:00',
             format='iso', scale='utc')
>>> t
<Time object: scale='utc' format='iso'
              vals=2010-06-01 00:00:00.000>

\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{format} argument specifies how to interpret the input values, e.g. ISO
or JD or Unix time.  The \texttt{scale} argument specifies the time scale for the
values, e.g. UTC or TT or UT1.  The available time scales are listed in the
table below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Scale  & Description \\
TAI    & International Atomic Time \\
TCB    & Barycentric Coordinate Time \\
TCG    & Geocentric Coordinate Time \\
TDB    & Barycentric Dynamical Time \\
TT     & Terrestrial Time \\
UT1    & Universal Time \\
UTC    & Coordinated Universal Time \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Getting the representation of the time in a different format such as Julian
Date or Year:Day-of-year is straightforward:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t.jd
2455348.5
>>> t.yday
'2010:152:00:00:00.000'
\end{verbatim}

One can also convert to a different time scale, for instance from UTC to
TT.  This uses the same attribute mechanism as above but now returns a new
\texttt{Time} object:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t_tt = t.tt
>>> t_tt
<Time object: scale='tt' format='iso'
              vals=2010-06-01 00:01:06.184>
>>> t_tt.jd
2455348.5007660184
\end{verbatim}

Note that both the ISO and JD representations of \verb|t_tt| are different than for
\verb|t| because they are expressed relative to the TT time scale.

In addition to representing absolute times, the \verb|Time| class supports
basic arithmetic to compute the duration between two times or to add or
subtract a duration from a time.  The example below also shows that when
creating a \verb|Time| object the time format for unambiguous inputs can be
automatically determined:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t2 = Time('2010:153', scale='utc')
>>> dt = t2 - t
>>> dt.sec
86400.0
>>> dt.jd
1.0
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Tables and Gridded data}

% Authors: Tom A., Tom R., Wolfgang K., Erik T.

\label{sec:table}

The \texttt{astropy.table} and \texttt{astropy.nddata} sub-packages contain
classes (\texttt{Table} and \texttt{NDData}) that allow users to represent
astronomical data in the form of tables or n-dimensional gridded datasets,
including meta-data (for example units).

The \texttt{Table} class provides a high-level wrapper to Numpy structured
arrays, which are essentially arrays that have fields (or columns) with
heterogeneous data types, and any number of rows. Numpy structured arrays are
however difficult to manipulate or modify, so the \texttt{Table} class makes
it easy for users to create a table from columns, add/remove columns or rows,
and mask values from the table. In addition, tables can be easily
read/written from/to common file formats using the \texttt{Table.read} and
\texttt{Table.write} methods. In addition to providing easy manipulation and
input/output of table objects, the \texttt{Table} class allows units to be
specified for each column using the \texttt{astropy.units} framework, and
also allows the \texttt{Table} object to contain arbitrary meta-data (stored
in \texttt{Table.meta}).


The \texttt{NDData} class ...

\subsection{File Formats}


\subsubsection{FITS}

% Authors: Erik B.


\subsubsection{ASCII table formats}

% Authors: Tom A.

The \texttt{astropy.io.ascii} package (formerly the standalone project
\texttt{asciitable}\footnote{https://asciitable.readthedocs.org}) provides the
ability to read and write tabular data for a wide variety of ASCII-based
formats.  In addition to generic formats like space-delimited, tab-delimited or
comma-separated values, \texttt{astropy.io.ascii} provides classes for specialized
table formats like
CDS\footnote{\url{http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/doc/catstd.htx}},
IPAC\footnote{\url{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html}},
IRAF DAOphot, and LaTeX.  There is also a flexible class for handling
a wide variety of fixed-width table formats.

As a simple example, suppose the file named \verb|sources.dat| has the following
table information:

\begin{verbatim}
obsid redshift  X      Y     object
3102  0.32      4167  4085   Q1250+568-A
877   0.22      4378  3892   "Source 82"
\end{verbatim}

This table can be read with the following:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from astropy.io import ascii
>>> data = ascii.read("sources.dat")
>>> print data
obsid redshift  X    Y      object
----- -------- ---- ---- -----------
 3102     0.32 4167 4085 Q1250+568-A
  877     0.22 4378 3892   Source 82
\end{verbatim}

This table can then be written out as a LaTeX table with the following:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> ascii.write(data, 'sources.tex',
                Writer=ascii.Latex)
>>> cat sources.tex
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
obsid & redshift & X & Y & object \\
3102 & 0.32 & 4167 & 4085 & Q1250+568-A \\
877 & 0.22 & 4378 & 3892 & Source 82 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}

As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:table} there is an alternate way of
reading and writing tables which is more intuitive in many cases.
The previous example could be done with the following:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from astropy.table import Table
>>> data = Table.read('sources.dat',
                      format='ascii')
>>> data.write('sources.tex', format='ascii',
               Writer=ascii.Latex)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Virtual Observatory tables}

% Authors: Mike D.
\texttt{astropy.io.votable} (formerly the standalone project
\texttt{vo.table}) provides full support for reading and writing
VOTable format files versions 1.1 and 1.2
\citep{ochsenbein2004votable,ochsenbein2009votable}.  It efficently
stores the tables in memory as Numpy structured arrays.  The file is
read using streaming to avoid reading in the entire file at once and
greatly reducing the memory footprint.

It is possible to convert any one of the tables in a VOTable file to
an \texttt{astropy.table.Table} object (\S\ref{sec:table}), where it
can be edited and then written back to a VOTable file without any loss
of data.

The VOTable standard is not strictly adhered to by all VOTable file
writers in the wild.  Therefore, \texttt{astropy.io.votable} provides
a number of tricks and workarounds to support as many VOTable sources
as possible, whenever the result would not be ambiguous.  A validation
tool (\texttt{volint}) is also provided that outputs recommendations
to improve the standard compliance of a given file, as well as
validate it against the official VOTable schema.

Support for VOTable 1.3 is planned for the future.

\subsection{World Coordinate Systems}

% Authors: Mike D.

\texttt{astropy.wcs} contains utilities for managing World Coordinate
System (WCS) transformations in FITS files.  These transformations map
the pixel locations in an image to their real-world units, such as
their position on the celestial sphere.  This library is specific to
WCS as it relates to FITS as described in the FITS WCS papers
\citep{greisen2002wcs,calabretta2002wcs,greisen2006wcs} and is
distinct from a planned Astropy package that will handle WCS
transformations in general, regardless of their representation.

\texttt{astropy.wcs} is a wrapper around Mark Calabretta's
\texttt{wcslib} \citep{calabretta2013wcslib}.  Since all of the FITS
header parsing is done using \texttt{wcslib}, it is assured the same
behavior as the many other tools that use \texttt{wcslib}.  On top of
the basic FITS WCS support, it adds support for the Simple Imaging
Polynomial (SIP) convention and table lookup distortions as defined in
the draft WCS ``Paper IV'' \citep{calabretta2004wcs}.  Each of these
transformations can be used independently or together in a fixed
pipeline.

\texttt{astropy.wcs} also serves as a useful FITS WCS validation tool,
as it is able to report on many common mistakes or deviations from the
standard in a given FITS file.

\subsection{Cosmology}

% Authors: Neil Crighton, Alex Conley

The \texttt{astropy.cosmology} sub-package contains classes for
representing widely used cosmologies, and functions for calculating
quantities that depend on a cosmological model. It also contains a
framework for working with less frequently employed cosmologies that
may be not be flat, or have a time-varying pressure to density ratio,
$w$, for dark energy. The quantities that can be calculated are
generally taken from those described by \citet{Hogg99}. Some examples
are the angular diameter distance, comoving distance, critical
density, distance modulus, lookback time, luminosity distance, and
Hubble parameter as a function of redshift.

The fundamental model for this sub-package is that any given cosmology
is represented by a class. An instance of this class has attributes
giving all the parameters required to uniquely specify the cosmology,
such as the Hubble parameter, CMB temperature and the baryonic, cold
dark matter, and dark energy densities at $z=0$. One can then use
methods of this class to perform calculations using these parameters.

For example, the \texttt{FlatLambdaCDM} class represents a flat
cosmology with a cosmological constant. To create an object
representing a flat cosmology \texttt{cosmo} with a Hubble parameter
$H_{z=0} = 70$~km\,s$^{-1}$\,Mpc and $\Omega_{M,z=0} = 0.3$, one would
use:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
>>> cosmo = FlatLambdaCDM(H0=70, Om0=0.3)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Then the comoving volume (for example) can be calculated at
redshift $6.5$ using the \texttt{comoving\_volume} method:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> cosmo.comoving_volume(6.5)
1074707289417.6837
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Further calculations can be performed using the many methods
of \texttt{cosmo}, such as \texttt{cosmo.lookback\_time} and
\texttt{cosmo.comoving\_distance}.  For users who are more comfortable
using a procedural coding style, these methods are also available as
functions that take a cosmology class instance as a keyword argument.

The sub-package provides several pre-defined cosmology instances
corresponding to commonly used cosmological parameter sets. Currently
parameters from the WMAP 5-year \citep{Komatsu09}, 7-year
\citep{Komatsu11} and 9-year results \citep{Hinshaw13} are included
(\texttt{WMAP5}, \texttt{WMAP7} and \texttt{WMAP9}). There are several
classes corresponding to non-flat cosmologies, and the most common
dark energy models are supported: a cosmological constant, constant
$w$, and $w(a) = w_0 + w_a (1-a)$ (e.g. \citealt{Linder03}, here $a$
is the scale factor). Any other arbitrary cosmology can be represented
by sub-classing one of the basic cosmology classes.

All of the code in the sub-package is tested against the web-based
cosmology calculator by \citet{Wright06} and two other widely-used
calculators\footnote{\url{http://www.kempner.net/cosmic.php},\\ \url{http://www.icosmos.co.uk/index.html}}.
In cases when these calculators are not precise enough to enable a
meaningful comparison, the code is tested against calculations
performed with \textsc{Mathematica}.
